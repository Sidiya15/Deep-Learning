# Deep-Learning

It's well known that labeling all data can be expensive and on top of that, time consuming. Therefore, semi-supervised models are the best tool known nowadays to work around this problem. Generative adversial networks are generative learning methods. Their goal is to train a generator network  which produces images of handwritten digits from the data 
 by transforming vectors of noise z into vectors x = G (z; Î¸^(G)). The generic model is trained by a classifier network D (x) which is trained to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generic model pmodel (x). Then the generator is in turn trained to bypass the classifier.
