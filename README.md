# Deep-Learning

It's well known that labeling all data can be expensive and on top of that, time consuming. Therefore, semi-supervised models are the best tool known nowadays to work around this problem. Generative adversial networks are generative learning methods. Their goal is to train a generator network G(z; θ<sup>(G)</sup>) which produces images of handwritten digits from the data P_{data}(x) by transforming vectors of noise z into vectors x = G(z; θ<sup>(G)</sup>). The generic model is trained by a classifier network D(x) which is trained to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generic model pmodel (x). Then the generator is in turn trained to bypass the classifier.
